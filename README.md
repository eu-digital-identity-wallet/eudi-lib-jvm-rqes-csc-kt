## Overview

This is a Kotlin library, targeting JVM, that supports
the [Cloud Signature Consortium API (version 2)](https://cloudsignatureconsortium.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/csc-api-v2.0.0.2.pdf)
protocol.

## Implemented features

The library supports the following remote service API endpoints:

| Method                        | Support |
|-------------------------------|---------|
| info                          | ✅       |
| auth/login                    | ❌       |
| auth/revoke                   | ❌       |
| credentials/list              | ✅       |
| credentials/info              | ✅       |
| credentials/authorize         | ❌       |
| credentials/authorizeCheck    | ❌       |
| credentials/getChallenge      | ❌       |
| credentials/extendTransaction | ❌       |
| signatures/signHash           | ✅       |
| signatures/signDoc            | ❌       |
| signatures/signPolling        | ❌       |
| signatures/timestamp          | ❌       |

Additionally, the library supports the following authorization methods:

|            | OAuth 2.0 | Explicit |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Service    | ✅         | ❌        |
| Credential | ✅         | ❌        | 

### ❗Important note on hash calculation and signature embedding

This library is exposing methods for calculating a document's digest and for embedding a signature to the document. 
However, this functionality is not implemented in the library itself, but is delegated to an external component.   
This component is not part of the library and must be provided by the library consumer. Alternative, the library consumer 
can implement the hash calculation and signature embedding logic in their own application.

In future versions of the library, this functionality may be implemented directly in the library.

## Interactions between the library, the caller and the RSSP

## Document Retrieval flow

> [!WARNING]
> This flow is not part of the CSC API specification and may be removed in future versions of the library.

This library is also implementing a flow call Document Retrieval, that allows a Relying Party (RP) to communication to the Caller the location of the documents to be signed.
It also provides a way for the Caller to provide the signed documents or signatures back to the RP.
This flow resembles a Verifiable Presentation flow.

The Caller must first acquire a request URI from the RP, usually by scanning a QR code. The request URI is then provided to the Library, which will retrieve the request object from the RP:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Caller
    participant Library
    participant RP
    autonumber
    Caller ->> RP: Scan QR code to retrieve request URI
    activate RP
    RP ->> Caller: Return request URI
    deactivate RP
    Caller ->> Library: Initiate document retrieval,<br/>providing the request URI
    activate Library
    Library ->> RP: GET request object
    RP ->> Library: Return request object
    Library ->> Library: Parse and validate request object
    Library ->> Caller: Return validated request object
    deactivate Library
```

At this point the Caller has a request object that contains information about the documents location, their hashes as well as the access method for the retrieval of the documents.
The Caller can now download the documents, compute theis hashes, and compare them with the hashes in the request object in order to ensure the integrity of the documents:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Caller
    participant RP
    autonumber
    activate Caller
    Caller ->> RP: Download documents
    RP ->> Caller: Return documents
    Caller ->> Caller: Calculate document hashes and compare<br/>with the hashes in the request object
    deactivate Caller
```
The Caller can now start the signing flow as described in the previous section. After completion, the Caller can now communicate the signed documents or signatures back to the RP:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Caller
    participant Library
    participant RP
    autonumber
    Caller ->> Library: Signed documents or signatures
    activate Library
    Library ->> RP: Send signed documents or signatures
    RP ->> Library: Return response
    Library ->> Caller: Return response
    deactivate Library
```

> [!TIP]
> A code example of how to use the Document Retrieval flow can be found in the [DocumentRetrievalFlowTest](src/test/kotlin/eu/europa/ec/eudi/DocumentRetrievalExample.kt) file.

## Disclaimer

The released software is an initial development release version:
-  The initial development release is an early endeavor reflecting the efforts of a short timeboxed period, and by no means can be considered as the final product.
-  The initial development release may be changed substantially over time, might introduce new features but also may change or remove existing ones, potentially breaking compatibility with your existing code.
-  The initial development release is limited in functional scope.
-  The initial development release may contain errors or design flaws and other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss.
-  The initial development release has reduced security, privacy, availability, and reliability standards relative to future releases. This could make the software slower, less reliable, or more vulnerable to attacks than mature software.
-  The initial development release is not yet comprehensively documented.
-  Users of the software must perform sufficient engineering and additional testing in order to properly evaluate their application and determine whether any of the open-sourced components is suitable for use in that application.
-  We strongly recommend to not put this version of the software into production use.
-  Only the latest version of the software will be supported
